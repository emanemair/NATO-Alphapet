## Getting Started
> Prerequisites
Before using this program, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

. Python (3.x recommended)

. A CSV file named nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv containing the NATO phonetic alphabet mappings.
## Installation
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have the required prerequisites installed.
3. Place the nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv file in the same directory as the Python script.
## Usage
> To use the NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter, follow these steps:

Run the Python script nato_converter.py.
Enter your name when prompted. The program will convert your name into its NATO phonetic alphabet representation and display the result.
Input
The program takes a single input: the user's name. It prompts the user to enter their name, which should consist of letters (uppercase or lowercase).

## Output
The program outputs the NATO phonetic alphabet representation of the user's name.
